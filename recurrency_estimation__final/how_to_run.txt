activate your custom bash:
$ bash

use the py37 environment in /home/loidolt/miniconda3:
$ conda activate py37

start a jupyter notebook on either rudabeh or tahmineh if you want to use the mpavich queue on either zal or sam; set the ip to 0.0.0.0 and define a port, use & to have it run in the background
$ jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8890 &

use port forwarding on your local machine to connect to the jupyter notebook:
$ ssh -L 8890:rudabeh001:8890 mpids
(this requires you to define the hosts rudabeh001 and mpids in your local ssh settings)

run the analysis:
# start a cluster with start_cluster.ipynb
# copy the scheduler ip-adress into the client settings in run_analysis.ipynb
# run the analysis
# save the results with an appropriate name

plot the results:
# 

connect to the dask dashboard:
$ ssh -L 8787:rudabeh001:8787 mpids ssh -L 8787:172.9.50.181:8787 rudabeh001 (scheduler IP in the second ssh command, dashboard port in all of them)
